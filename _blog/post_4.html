<p>This question serves as good exercise to see how forward propagation works and then how the gradients are computed to implement the backpropagation algorithm.
Also, the reader will get comfortable with the computation of vector, tensor derivatives and vector/matrix calculus.
A useful document can be found <a href="https://compsci697l.github.io/docs/vecDerivs.pdf">here</a> for the interested reader to get familiar with tensor operations.</p>

  
<p>Compute the gradients and derivatives of the loss function of the given neural network as shown in the figure below
with respect to the parameters: <span class="math inline">\(W_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(W_{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_{2}\)</span>.
Where <span class="math inline">\(W_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(W_{2}\)</span> are the weight matrices;
and <span class="math inline">\(b_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_{2}\)</span> are bias the vectors.
Let <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathcal{R}^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(W_{1} \in \mathcal{R}^{2*500}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_{1} \in \mathcal{R}^{500}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(W_{2} \in \mathcal{R}^{500*2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_{2} \in \mathcal{R}^2\)</span>.
Also, show how the forward and backpropagation algorithms work.</p>
