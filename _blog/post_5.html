<p>Suppose you have satellite imagery for an Area of Interest (AOI). You can do all sorts of analysis. But, with the advent of deep learning you want to 
  to some really cool stuff. But before that, you want to get the footprints of all the buildings in the Le Plateau area of Montreal or all the 
  roads in SoMA in San Francisco or perhaps you want to see where are all the general amentities in the Italian quarter in Boston. </p>
  
<p>Let us first see what we want to achieve</p>

<p>So, you have the four coordinates of the AOI. You want to do the follwoing in order:
  1. Get the orginal image of the AOI.
  2. Get the footprint of all the amenities you are looking for (here, highways/roads)
  3. Then you want save this save an image
  4. You also want to overlay this on top of a map (Google Maps, perhaps?)
  5. But wait, you also want to save a geoJSON file of the region.
  </p>

  
<p> 
Go to geojson.io Once, you are there you have the choice to select an AOI using the cursor. Go to your faviurite city and draw an
 AOI. I have drawn one in Montreal (the city I am currently writing this post from). Once you have selected the AOI, go ahead and 
  save the coordinates as a geoJSON file. You can do that by using the Save scroll-down menu at the top left corner of the website.
 Just to confrim, have a look at the file I get for the selected AOI.
