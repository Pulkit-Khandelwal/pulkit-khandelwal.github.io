<p>
  I got introduced to super dope fields of Geographic Information Systems, Spatial Analysis and Satellite Imaging while
  I interened at Planet in San Francisco. This series of posts will introduce you to a side project that I accomplished.
  Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/kscottz?lang=en">Kat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kylehounslow">Kyle</a>, my mentors at Planet. Disclamer: Credits will be given where they are due.
  I will assume that you might know certain concepts and tools at the start of each part of this tutorial. In case you do not
  know them, don't worry you can always look them up and come back to the tutorial afterwards. But, between you and me; do come
  back! In any case I will mention the things to know at the start of each part of this series. Like this:
</p>


<h2>Things to know or to brush up</h2>

<ol>
  <li>json and geoJSON file formats</li>
</ol>
  
 
<p>Suppose you have satellite imagery for an Area of Interest (AOI). You can do all sorts of crazy things with that in the computer visio
  and machine learning community. But given just a geoJSON file of an AOI, how can you get the footprints of all the buildings in the Le Plateau area of Montreal or all the 
  roads/alleys in the South of Market (SoMA) district in San Francisco or perhaps you want to see where are all the general amentities in the Italian quarter in Boston.
  Once, you have got the footprints as a geoJSON file, can you save them as images (tif, png or anything you like). And, finally
  you know what you can do with these images? Yes, you guessed it right. Analyse the hell out of it.</p>
  
<p>Let us first see some pretty images.</p>
 
<figure>

<figcaption>Fig 1. Satellite image of the city of Amsterdam</figcaption>

<figcaption>Fig 1. Buildings in the city of Amsterdam</figcaption>
</figure>
  

<p>
Let's say we have the four coordinates (we will see how to get those in this tutorial) of some region on earth. We call
  the region as our AOI. Below is a list of tasks that we would like to accomplish with this AOI... 
</p>
  
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Get the orginal image of the AOI. Figure 1 is an example of this.</li>
  <li>Get the footprint of all the amenities you are looking for (here, highways/roads). The footprint means the
  coordintes of each of the building, road, park, waterbody etc. in our original AOI. geoJSON file will handle that.
  </li>
  <li>Then you want save this save an image. Figures 2 and 3 shows the roads and the buildings. </li>
  <li>You also want to overlay this on top of a map (Google Maps, perhaps?). This will be accomplished using the awesome
  Python visualisation library aka Bokeh. </li>
</ol>
  
 
<p> 
  In this first part of the tutorial series, we will first extract the AOI of some desired region and save
  that as a geoJSON file. Next, we will repeat small exercise on Open Street Maps' web API but this time
  we will also query buildings (or highways) and save the entire footprint as a geoJSON. We will stop and ponder
  over the saved geoJSON files. We can save the footprints as images or html files.
</p> 


<h2> Select an AOI and save that as geoJSON</h2>
  
<p>
 Let's explore <a href="http://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a>. 
 You have the choice to select an AOI using the cursor. Go to your favorite city and draw an
 AOI. You can do that either select a rectangular region or an arbitrary polygon. Let's draw a rectangular region for now.
 I have drawn one in Montreal (the city I am currently writing this post from). Next, on the right side you can see the JSON
 tab. By clicking that you can see the coordinates of the given region. Remember that each coordinate is in the form: 
  (longitude, latitude). On the left panel we have the option to save these coordinates in various forms. For now, we will save
  it as geoJSON.
 
Here is the geoJSON file that I got for roughly Montreal's Lower Plateau area. Fun fact: I love the cafe culture in this city!
</p>
 
<pre class="prettyprint">

{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon",
"coordinates":
[[[-73.58076095581055,45.509474756808736],
[-73.55835914611816,45.509474756808736],
[-73.55835914611816,45.52081177681294],
[-73.58076095581055,45.52081177681294],
[-73.58076095581055,45.509474756808736]]]}}]}
}

</pre>
  
  
  
<p>
 I have also included a screenshot below to make sure we have the right thing with us.

</p>

<figcaption>Fig 4. Montreal's Le Plateau AOI</figcaption>
</figure>
 
  
<p>
Next, we should see a similar thing on Open Stret Map's API: turbo-pass.eu
Just as we did before, go ahead and select a region of interest. This time I am going with a small part of the financial
disctrict in San Francisco. 
But, this time we wil do a little bit more. On the menu bar at the top of the website, you should be an interesting option
named: Wizard. Click on that and feel free to explore in your free time. For now, type in building in the query box and then click on the

build and run option. You should see a code generated on the left side of your screen and it appears like this. Make
sure you have got the same thing. 
  
<pre><code>
/*
This has been generated by the overpass-turbo wizard.
The original search was:
“building”
*/
[out:json][timeout:25];
// gather results
(
  // query part for: “building”
  node["building"]({{bbox}});
  way["building"]({{bbox}});
  relation["building"]({{bbox}});
);
// print results
out body;
>;
out skel qt;
</code></pre>
  
  
 
<figure>
<img src="https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/aoi_footprint_post/blob/master/images/build_query.png?raw=true" alt="Build Query for buildings" width="600" height="600" align="middle">
<figcaption>Fig 5. Build Query for buildings</figcaption>
</figure>
  
What you have got is a code snippet which runs on the server and queries all the buildings in the given AOI.
  You can see that on the maps. The footprint of each of the building is shown as bounding boxes. Go ahead
  and zoom in to see the different buildings. Did you get something like this?

<figcaption>Fig 6. Buildings in San Francisco in the selected AOI</figcaption>
</figure>


And now you are probably wondering can I save this data?
Ofcourse, we can! And we will do that in three different ways.

1. Let us get a geoJSON file just like we did before. To do that click on export and then save the file as a geoJSON.
  If you go through the file, you should see that there is tons of information out there.
Let us see:
  You get the coordinates of each building. Wow. What is more interesing is the additional information taht you get out of it.

  Here is my file. And the first few lines of the file....

        ]
      },

 </code></pre> 

2. Save this AOI as an image. Click on export and then select the save as png file option.

3. You can also open this on a map and get a weblink which you play around with later.

We will stop with that in this tutorial. In the next part of this series, we wil dive into the code and actually get to the meat
  of the problem!
