  Hi there! I hope you'd enjoyed the previous part of this tutorial. If you haven't checked that out, then I recommend you
  to do so before reading this part. In the previous post we had seen what we would like to achieve using Overpass,
  OSM's web API. In this part we shall dive into wrting python code to do so. For this we will use overpy, a python wrapper
  to the Overpass API.
</p>

<h2>Things to know or to brush up</h2>

<ol>
  <li> geoPandas and gdal </li>
  <li> Basic understanding of GIS using Python. Here you can find a very detailed and wonderful tutorial</li>
  <li> Go over <a href="">overPy</a> python wrapper's documentation. Make sure to understand the syntax. In any case we will
   cover that in the tutorial. </li>
</ol>

<p>
We will cover each part step by step by going over and understaning the code. I will cover only the crux of the 
  code and its logic. You can find the code in its entirity here.
Make sure to have all the libraries installed. I am using Python 3.6, have anaconda installed on my system. I wrapped the code
to make a simple API. You can play around with that in this jupyter notebook. Let's start then!

</p>
  
  
<h2>Step 0: Import Statements</h2>

<pre class="prettyprint" linenums>
import overpy
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon, LineString
from osgeo import gdal, ogr
</pre>
  
  
<h2>Step 1: Read the geoJSON file and extract the bounds of the AOI</h2>
 
<pre class="prettyprint" linenums:1>
input_aoi = gpd.read_file(aoi)

bounds_coords = input_aoi['geometry'].bounds

south = bounds_coords['miny'][0]
west = bounds_coords['minx'][0]
north = bounds_coords['maxy'][0]
east = bounds_coords['maxx'][0]
</pre>

  
<p>
<ol>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>We are given a geoJSON file (with the AOI) as an input. Remember from the last post that we had the bounding box coordinates saved as
a geoJSON file. You can use this file here. We will then read this file using the geoPandas library.</li>
<li>In line 3 we then find the bounds of the four coordinates. This will help us to find the four coordinates.</li>
<li>Lines 4-7 does exactly that. We save this in four different variables.</li>
</ol>
</p>
  
  
  
  
<h2>Step 2: Query the OverPass API using the overpy wrapper</h2>

<pre class="prettyprint" linenums:1>
api = overpy.Overpass()

query_str = '[out:json];way({south:.8f}, {west:.8f}, {north:.8f},
               {east:.8f})[{query_landmark:.50s}]; (._;>;); out;'

query_aoi = query_str.format(north=north, south=south, east=east, west=west, query_landmark='building')

query_result = api.query(query_aoi)
</pre>
  
  
<p>
<ol>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>First and foremost we initialise an object of the Overpy API </li>
<li>In line 3 we write a query in the format prescribed by Overpy. The query string accepts the four coordinates of the
bounding box which we have already estimated in the previous step. As the fifth argument, the landmark that we are interested in
is provided. Here, <b>building</b> Take your own time to understand the syntax here. It took
to me quite soemtime to wrap my head around it </li>
<li>In line 6 the arguments are passed using <b>format</b> </li>
<li>Next, we query the Overpass API using the overpy wrapper to get all the buildings in the AOI. <b>query_result</b> stores the
query.</li>
</ol>
</p>
  
  
  
  
<h2>Step 3: Get all the desired footprints in the AOI</h2>

<pre class="prettyprint" linenums:1>
result_ways = query_result.ways

nodes_of_ways = [way.get_nodes(resolve_missing=True) for way in result_ways]

list_lon_lat = []
for way in nodes_of_ways:
    list_of_ways = []
    for node in way:
        list_of_ways.append([float(node.lon), float(node.lat)])
    list_lon_lat.append(list_of_ways)
</pre>
  


<p>
<ol>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li> There is something known as <b>ways</b>, <b>nodes</b> and <b>relations</b> which
  in lay man term's is a way to represent each of the
  desired footprint. Let's say our desired footprint is buildings in the AOI. Each building is referred to as <b>way</b> and
each of such a building is represented by some <b>nodes</b>. Each node is thus a coordinate of the building polygon. Each node
has longitue and a latitude. We need to go through each of them step by step and extract all this information. We also
  have to make sure that we represent this information in a nice manner.</li>
<li> Line 1 gets all the <b>ways</b> in the given AOI. </li>
<li> Line 3 iterates through each of the ways and gets all the nodes in them. We collect all the nodes of given way
in a list. And we do this for all the ways. Thus, we get a list of lists. I hope this makes sense. If not then I recommend yo to go
  over through overpy's or OSM's documentation.</li>
<li> Lines 5 through 10, loops over all the nodes in all the ways; and get all the (longitute,latitude) of the
  different nodes. If for examples we are looking for buildings then each of these (lon,lat) are bounding positions of the
polygon</li>
</ol>

That's a lot to digest. Take your time and then proceed. No hurry!
</p>
  
  
<h2>Step 4: Create a geoDataFrame to store the query and its metadata</h2>  
  
<pre class="prettyprint" linenums:1>
geopandas_dataframe = gpd.GeoDataFrame()
geopandas_dataframe['geometry'] = None

for index, way in enumerate(result_ways):
    coordinates = list_lon_lat[index]

    if coordinates[0] == coordinates[-1]:
        geopandas_dataframe.loc[index, 'geometry'] = Polygon(coordinates)
    elif len(coordinates) == 1:
        geopandas_dataframe.loc[index, 'geometry'] = Point(coordinates)
    else:
        geopandas_dataframe.loc[index, 'geometry'] = LineString(coordinates)

    geopandas_dataframe.loc[index, 'way id'] = str(way)
    geopandas_dataframe.loc[index, 'expanded_tag'] = str(way.tags)
    geopandas_dataframe.loc[index, 'queried_tag'] = tag

geopandas_dataframe.crs = {'init': 'epsg:4326'}
</pre>
  


<p>
<ol>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
We will put all of the stuff in step 3 into geoPandas dataframe, so that we can use it later with ease!
  
<li>In line 1 we create an empty geoPandas dataframe. Line 2 creates a column called <b>geometry</b>. This column
is where we will store each of the way in its appropriate shape viz. Point, Polygon or a LineString. </li>
<li>The for loop goes over each of the ways and determines whether each way is a Polygon, Point or a Line.
In case we have buildings the it is: Polygon</li>
<li>The last three lines of the for loop stores the metadata associated with each way in three different columns. We won't do
anything with this in this tutorial series but it is always nice to have that data stored for later use!</li>
<li>the line in this code snippet specifies the Coordinate Refrence System! More information <a href="http://geopandas.org/projections.html">here</a>. </li>
  
</ol>
 
  
<h2>Step 5: Save the geoDataframe as a geoJSON file</h2>  
  
<pre class="prettyprint" linenums:1>
name='name_of_geojson_file.geojson'

print('Saving as a geoJSON file as {name}'.format(name=name))
with open(name, 'w') as file:
    file.write(geopandas_dataframe.to_json())
</pre>
 
<p>
<ol>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>In line 1 we provide a name for the geojson file.</li>
<li>Next, we save the geoPandas dataframe obtained from the earlier steps as a geojson file.</li>
</ol>
  
  
  
<h2>Step 6: Save the geoDataframe as a shapely object</h2>  
<p>
Note that if the dataframe has multiple geometries, then we should convert them to a single geometry
otherwise a shape file cannot be generated. Hence we will employ a hack in this part.
</p>  
  
<pre class="prettyprint" linenums:1>
# Check which geometry occurs the most
geopandas_dataframe['geom_type'] = None
for index, row in geopandas_dataframe.iterrows():
     row['geom_type'] = row['geometry'].geom_type

max_occur_geom = geopandas_dataframe['geom_type'].value_counts().idxmax()

for index, row in data.iterrows():
geom = row['geometry']
if geom.geom_type is not max_occur_geom:
    if max_occur_geom == 'LineString':
        row['geometry'] = LineString(list(geom.exterior.coords))
    if max_occur_geom == 'Polygon':
        # for now let's handle it by deleting the row
        # though the LineString should be converted to a polygon
        data.drop(index, inplace=True)
    if max_occur_geom == 'Point':
        row['geometry'] = Point(list(geom.exterior.coords))

# Save as a shape file
data.to_file(name)

</pre>
 
<p>
<ol>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Lines  2-4 checks which geometry occurs the most. Let's say for the case where we query all the buildings,
  we get Polygons but there might be some outliers where we get some other object like Lines or Points. This might arise
  beacuse of some improper labelled data in OSM.</li>
<li>So, in that case we should either convert those outliers to Polygons or just discard them. This is handled by
  the second part of the code snippet. </li>
<li>Finally, save it as a shapely object!</li>
</ol>  
  
  

<h2>Credits and References</h2>
<ol>
The code was written during my internship. I should give credits to Planet and all the other cool open source projects and
libraries/APIs that were used to make this possible. If you feel that I have missed some credits, feel free to email me and
I will make sure they appear here.
