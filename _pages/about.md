Let's start with my favourite quote by Randy Pausch
> Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.
> And experience is often the most valuable thing you have to offer.

Hi! I'm Pulkit. I am currently working towards a Master's degree in Computer Science at McGill in the beautiful city of Montreal in Canada. Thank you for stopping by my webpage. Everything can be found on the left navigation panel. While you are here you might want to check out my reading list. I like that a lot, you should too! Also, my love for coffee and chai makes a perfect duo for books. I often take long walks and my headphones are always on and I bike too. A lot. Stamps and coins fascinate me. I have lived in India for the first twenty years of my life and have been to almost every part of my homeland. Since, 2015 I have been in and out of India, Canada and Australia. I love all three countries and can go on and on. Do check out some photographs. I take a lot of MOOCs and read academic papers. May be we could talk over a cup of coffee? I can be bribed that way too easily.

Before coming to McGill, I earned a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at VIT University, India. I have previously worked at the Centre for Advanced Imaging in University of Queensland, Imaging and Graphics Lab, University of Saskatchewan and Psi Phi Labs, a startup based out of Bangalore. At McGill, I have joined the Shape Analysis Group under the supervision of Kaleem Siddqi (McGill).
