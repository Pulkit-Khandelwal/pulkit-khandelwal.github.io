**NEW** Invited as a guest on the podcast, "Abstract: The Future of Science". Listen [here](https://anchor.fm/abstractcast).

**NEW** *Updated CV January 2022 available [**here**](https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/blob/master/Pulkit_Khandelwal_CV.pdf)*

I'm a PhD student at the [Penn Image Computing and Science (PICSL)](http://picsl.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania  under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Yushkevich](http://picsl.upenn.edu/people-staff-james-c-gee/faculty-staff/paul-yushkevich/). I am interested in Medical Image Analysis using shape, vision and learning methods. In particular, I'm interested in segmentation and registration of complex anatomical structures to aid image guided surgery and develop sensible biomarkers.

Previously, I obtained my MSc. in computer science at the [Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/) at McGill University, Montr√©al. I was supervised by [Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and [Prof. Louis Collins](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/) at the Montreal Neurological Institute. You can read my MSc. thesis [here](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29bb21t) titled "Spine Segmentation in Computed
Tomography Images using Geometric Flows and Shape Priors".

I also maintain a [blog](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/blog/) and contribute to open source projects [such as](https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/Reinforcement-Learning-Notebooks).

In the past, I've interened at:
* Imagia [Montreal, Canada]
* Planet Labs [San Francisco, United States]
* University of Queensland [Brisbane, Australia]
* University of Saskatchewan [Saskatoon, Canada]


In my spare time, I read poetry, books, listen to podcasts, nerd out on coffee, enjoy indie folk music, and am constantly searching for the next best cafe!

I believe in [**Slow Science**](http://slow-science.org/).
