Let's start with my favourite quote by Randy Pausch
> Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.

Starting Fall 2019, I will start a PhD at the University of Pennsylvania at the [Penn Image Computing and Science (PISCL)](http://picsl.upenn.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Yushkevich](http://picsl.upenn.edu/people-staff-james-c-gee/faculty-staff/paul-yushkevich/). Currently, I'm wrapping  MSc. at the [Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/) in the department of Computer Science at McGill Univeristy in the beautiful city of Montreal, Canada. I am supervised by [Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and [Louis Collins](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/) at the Montreal Neurological Institute. I am interested in Medical Image Analysis using shape, spectral, vision and learning methods. In particular, I'm interested in segmentation and registration of complex anatomical structures to aid image guided surgery and develop sensible biomarkers. For my MSc. thesis I'm developing precise and accurate models of the human vertebral column. To this end we are designing shape based geometric flows within a level-set formulation to automatically segment the human spine and each individual vertebrae in computed tomography volumes.

In my spare time, I maintain a [blog](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/blog/), act as a technical reviewer for [Packt publising](https://github.com/TrainingByPackt/Applied-Supervised-Learning-with-R/tree/master/Lesson07) and contribute to [open source projects](https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/Reinforcement-Learning-Notebooks).

I did some internships in the past:
* Worked on domain generalization and meta-learning for medical imaging at Imagia in Montreal, Canada
* A machine learning and software engineering gig at Planet Labs in San Francisco, United States
* Did some brain stuff at University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia
* Worked at the intersection of HCI and computer vision at University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada

I read [books](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/reading-list/), listen to a lot of podcasts and am in constant search for high quality [content](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/websites/) to digest.
