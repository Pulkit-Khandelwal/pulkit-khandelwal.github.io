I'm a postdoctoral reserach fellow at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital where I'm advised by [Prof. Lilla Zollei](https://lillazollei.github.io/) as part of the [FreeSurfer group](https://lcn.martinos.org/) at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. Previously, I was a postdoc in the department of Radiology at the University of Pennsylvania where I also completed my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Yushkevich](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p2693923). Before that, I completed MSc. in computer science in the [Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/) at McGill University where I was supervised by [Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and [Prof. Louis Collins](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/) at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Even before that, I obtained a BTech in ECE at VIT university, Vellore and completed my Bachelor's thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Steffen Bollmann](https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/11402) at the University of Queensland.

My primary research focus is to develop computational methods to analyze high resolution postmortem human brain MRI and link morphometry with histopathology to study both neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. You can find my latest body of work [here](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/exvivo-brain-upenn/). See my complete publications at [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6BOwPcoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My [PhD](https://www.proquest.com/docview/3217902703?sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses) and [MSc](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29bb21t) theses.

[**Curriculum Vitae**](https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/blob/master/Pulkit_Khandelwal_CV.pdf).

In the past, I've interned at:
* Google [Mountain View, United States]
* Amazon [Palo Alto, United States]
* Imagia Inc. [Montreal, Canada]
* Planet Labs [San Francisco, United States]
* Centre for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland [Brisbane, Australia]
* Imaging, Multimedia and Graphics Lab, University of Saskatchewan [Saskatoon, Canada]

Every Fall, I lecture on medical image segmentation with deep learning in the graduate course on biomedical image analysis (BE/CIS 537) at the University of Pennsylvania. You can view the recordings [here](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/medical-image-segmentation-deep-learning/).

I actively organize the [seminar series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZrwirZzeDlQL2d6dXVOhZVbaicm-OwRh&si=AWwFlTtrqjE_72fM) for the [RISE-MICCAI](https://rise-miccai.org/) society, where we discuss medical imaging papers and host panel discussions throughout the year.

I also maintain a [blog](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/blog/) and contribute to open-source projects such as [this](https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/Reinforcement-Learning-Notebooks) and have appeared as a guest on the ["Abstract: The Future of Science"](https://anchor.fm/abstractcast) podcast.

In my spare time, I read a lot of books, listen to science podcasts, nerd out over coffee, enjoy independent movies and music, and I'm constantly searching for the next best cafe.
I believe in [**Slow Science**](http://slow-science.org/).
