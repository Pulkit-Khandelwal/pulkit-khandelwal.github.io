I'm a postdoctoral researcher [Penn Image Computing and Science (PICSL)](http://picsl.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Yushkevich](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p2693923), where I also obtained my PhD. Previously, I completed MSc. in computer science in the [Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/) at McGill University where I was supervised by [Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and [Prof. Louis Collins](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/) at the Montreal Neurological Institute.

My primary research focus is to develop computational methods to analyze ultra-high resolution postmortem human brain at 7 tesla MRI and link morphometry with histopathology in Alzheimer's and related dementias. You can find my latest body of work [here](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/exvivo-brain-upenn/). See my complete publications at [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6BOwPcoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). See my MSc. thesis [here](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29bb21t).

[**Curriculum Vitae**](https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/blob/master/Pulkit_Khandelwal_CV.pdf).

In the past, I've interned at:
* Google [Mountain View, United States]
* Amazon [Palo Alto, United States]
* Imagia Inc. [Montreal, Canada]
* Planet Labs [San Francisco, United States]
* Centre for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland [Brisbane, Australia]
* Imaging, Multimedia and Graphics Lab, University of Saskatchewan[Saskatoon, Canada]

Every Fall, I lecture on medical image segmentation with deep learning in the graduate course on biomedical image analysis (BE/CIS 537) at the University of Pennsylvania. You can view the recordings [here](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/medical-image-segmentation-deep-learning/).

I also maintain a [blog](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/blog/) and contribute to open-source projects such as [this](https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/Reinforcement-Learning-Notebooks) and have appeared as a guest on the ["Abstract: The Future of Science"](https://anchor.fm/abstractcast) podcast.

In my spare time, I read poetry, fiction, and non-fiction, listen to science podcasts, nerd out on coffee, enjoy independent movies, music, and I'm constantly searching for the next best cafe!
I believe in [**Slow Science**](http://slow-science.org/).
