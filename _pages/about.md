Let's start with my favourite quote by Randy Pausch
> Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.
> And experience is often the most valuable thing you have to offer.

Hi! I'm Pulkit. I am a Master's student at the [Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/) in the department of Computer Science at McGill Univeristy in the beautiful city of Montreal, Canada. I am supervised by [Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and [Louis Collins](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/). I am interested in Computer Vision, Medical Image Analysis and Deep Learning. For my Master's thesis, I am interested in the segmentation of human vertebrae in CT scans. This is being accomplished by [Level-Sets](https://math.berkeley.edu/~sethian/2006/Explanations/level_set_explain.html) with [shape priors](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/327560/filename/Rousson.pdf). Currently, I am interning at [Imagia](https://www.imagia.com/) as a Computer Vision and Deep Learning Engineer where I am working on Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation.

I did some cool internships in the past:
* A machine learning and software engineering gig at Planet Labs in San Francisco, United States.
* Did some brain stuff at University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
* Did some image segmentation and HCI work at University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.

I read a lot of books and listen to a lot of podcasts. You should definitely check my reading list [here](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/reading-list/).
