I'm a PhD student in the [Penn Image Computing and Science (PICSL)](http://picsl.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Yushkevich](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p2693923). I'm interested in Medical Image Analysis using shape, vision and learning methods. In particular, I'm interested in image segmentation and registration of various anatomical structures to aid image-guided surgery and develop biomarkers for neurdegnerative diseases. Previously, I completed my MSc. in computer science in the [Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/) at McGill University, Montréal. I was supervised by [Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and [Prof. Louis Collins](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/) at the Montreal Neurological Institute. You can read my MSc. thesis [here](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29bb21t) titled "Spine Segmentation in Computed
Tomography Images using Geometric Flows and Shape Priors" or the jounral article [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2021.592296/full).

I also maintain a [blog](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/blog/) and contribute to open source projects such as [this](https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/Reinforcement-Learning-Notebooks).

In the past, I've interened at:
* [Imagia](https://imagia.com/) [Montreal, Canada]
* [Planet Labs](https://www.planet.com/) [San Francisco, United States]
* [Centre for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland](https://cai.centre.uq.edu.au/) [Brisbane, Australia]
* University of Saskatchewan [Saskatoon, Canada]

**Primary Research Interests**
My primary research focus is to develop biomarkers and understand how neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, spread in the brain using postmortem ex vivo human brain specimens scanned at ultra high resolution at 7 and 9.4 Tesla magnetic field strength magnetic resonance imaging. To this end, I develop methods to segment different cortical and subcortical structures in these high dimensional images using limited training data by leveraging methods based on meta-learning, domain disentanglement, generalization and few-shot learning. Separately, to link morphometry with underlying neuropathology, I’ve developed an end to end network to register ex vivo and in vivo images via generative adversarial networks within a contrastive learning framework and diffeomorphic deformable 3D image registration algorithms.

I’ve also developed methods based on geometric level sets and shape priors and geometric constraints based on medial axis representations to segment vertebrae in computed tomography images, to help image-guided neurosurgery. Furthermore, I’ve explored graph-based network analysis methods to investigate possible computational biomarkers to distinguish patients within the Alzheimer’s Disease spectrum.

In my spare time, I read poetry, books, listen to podcasts, nerd out on coffee, enjoy indie folk music, and am constantly searching for the next best cafe!
I believe in [**Slow Science**](http://slow-science.org/).
