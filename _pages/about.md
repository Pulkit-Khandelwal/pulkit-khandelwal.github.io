Let's start with my favourite quote by Randy Pausch
> Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.
> And experience is often the most valuable thing you have to offer.

**NEW** Invited as a guest on the podcast, "Abstract: The Future of Science". Listen [here](https://anchor.fm/abstractcast).

**NEW** *Updated CV and Publications August 2020*

I'm a PhD student at the [Penn Image Computing and Science (PICSL)](http://picsl.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania  under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Yushkevich](http://picsl.upenn.edu/people-staff-james-c-gee/faculty-staff/paul-yushkevich/). I am interested in Medical Image Analysis using shape, vision and learning methods. In particular, I'm interested in segmentation and registration of complex anatomical structures to aid image guided surgery and develop sensible biomarkers.

Previously, I obtained my MSc. in computer science at the [Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/) at McGill University, Montr√©al. I was supervised by [Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and [Prof. Louis Collins](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/) at the Montreal Neurological Institute. You can read my MSc. thesis [here](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29bb21t) titled "Spine Segmentation in Computed
Tomography Images using Geometric Flows and Shape Priors".

I also maintain a [blog](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/blog/), act as a technical reviewer for [technical books](https://github.com/TrainingByPackt/Applied-Supervised-Learning-with-R/tree/master/Lesson07) and contribute to [open source projects](https://github.com/Pulkit-Khandelwal/Reinforcement-Learning-Notebooks).

I did some internships in the past:
* Worked on domain generalization and meta-learning for medical imaging at Imagia in Montreal, Canada
* A machine learning and software engineering gig at Planet Labs in San Francisco, United States
* Did some brain stuff at University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia
* Worked at the intersection of HCI and computer vision at University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada


I read [books](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/reading-list/), listen to a lot of podcasts and am in constant search for high quality [content](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/websites/) to digest. I can listen to indie folk and indie rock all day. I also nerd out on coffee.

I believe in [**Slow Science**](http://slow-science.org/).
