Let's start with my favourite quote by Randy Pausch
> Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.
> And experience is often the most valuable thing you have to offer.

Hi! I'm Pulkit. I am a Master's student in the department of Computer Science at McGill Univeristy in the beautiful city of Montreal, Canada. I am supervised by [Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and [Louis Collins](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/). I am interested in Computer Vision, Medical Image Analysis and Deep Learning. For my Master's thesis, I am busy segmenting the human vertebrae in MRI scans. I use Partial Differntial Equations and level-sets with shape priors to make this possible.

I did some cool internships in the past:
A machine learning and software engineering gig at Planet Labs in San Francisco, United States.
Did some brain stuff at University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
Did some image segmnetation and HCI job at University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.

I read a lot of books and listen to a lot of podcasts. You should definitely check my reading list [*here*](https://pulkit-khandelwal.github.io/reading-list/).
