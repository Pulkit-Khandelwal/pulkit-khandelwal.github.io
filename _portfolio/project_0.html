title: "Spine Segmentation in CT volumes using geometric flows and shape priors"
excerpt: "Use of geometric flows with shape priors based on sparse field level-sets and additive operators to segment vertebral column
in the human spine. This provides a precise and accurate model for the image guided surgery system to help in surgical planning.

 <p>
 Each year more than 20,000 Canadians are treated surgically for lower back pain. Image guided surgical
   (IGS) techniques can reduce the number of complications that arise in about 20-30% of classical
   surgical procedures. Patients are often scanned for a CT pre-operatively and then, during the
   surgery, are scanned again using Ultrasound. The registration of the pre-operative CT scans
   with intra-operative ultrasound scans can help surgeons to perform surgeries with higher precisison.
   The segmentation of the spine in CT scans is, however, quite challenging. Inhomogenous regions inside
   and outside the vertebrae require the application of advanced segmentation methods. Signal loss
   at the boundaries of the vertebrae can further hinder the segmentation process. In this project
   we are working on developing precise and accurate models of the human vertebral column in collaboration
   with <a href="http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/"> Dr. Louis Collins</a>.
   To this end we are applying geometric flow methods combined with shape priors to
   automatically segment the entire spinal column as well as each vertebrae individually.
